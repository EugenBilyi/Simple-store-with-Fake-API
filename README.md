# GymBeam Case Study â€“ Simple Store with Fake API

## Objective

The objective of this case study is to create a simple web application using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, which displays a list of products and product details for authenticated users. Data is retrieved from the Fake Store API.

## Functional Requirements

- The customer can log in to the application (registration is optional).
- Authenticated users can access the product list and detail pages.
- The customer can log out of the application.
- Cart operations are not included.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- The application runs smoothly on major browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera).
- Consistent UI design aligned with the GymBeam brand.
- Uses the Fake Store API as a data source.
- The project can be executed locally.

## Output

- Screenshots of the application for both desktop and mobile views are located in the `/screenshots` folder inside the repository. Each screenshot is clearly named based on the page and device (e.g., `loginForm_mobile.jpg`, `productListPage_PC.jpg`).
- The source code is available in this GitHub repository and can be run locally following the instructions above.
